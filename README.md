# Reminder-Tool
Ever got super distracted scrolling through random stuff online when you should be doing homework or something important? Yeah, me too. So I made this thing to fix that lol.



What is it :


-So basically I made this Python program that puts a reminder text anywhere on your screen. 
-It's pretty cool because it stays on top of everything else so you can't just ignore it when your procrastinating.



What it can do:


Stays on top Like fr, it won't disappear behind other windows.
You can customize everything - Change the text, make it whatever color you want, resize it, etc :)

How does it work:


It's just Python code (with a bit of help from AI ;p ) that just chills on your screen reminding you to actually get stuff done!

How to use it:

-Moving the text - Triple click on the text and drag it around.

-Change the text or colors - Right-click on it and you'll see the options.

-Close it - Either close the command prompt or right-click and select "Force Stop".

How to run it:


1. Download the "reminder" from this repository.
2. Run the Python file.
3. And that's all!


PS I'm still working to make this better by releasing bug fixes and additional features!
