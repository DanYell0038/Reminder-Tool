# 🛠️ Reminder-Tool

Ever got super distracted scrolling through random stuff online when you should be doing homework or something important?  
Yeah, me too. So I made this thing to fix that lol. :P

## 1. WHAT IS IT ❓

-  So basically I made this Python program that puts a reminder text anywhere on your screen.  
-  It's pretty cool because it stays on top of everything else so you can't just ignore it when your procrastinating.  
-  Currently it's made for Windows.

## 2. WHAT CAN IT DO ✨

- 📌 Stays on top — Like fr, it won't disappear behind other windows.  
- 🎨 You can customize everything — Change the text, make it whatever color you want, resize it, etc :p

## 3. HOW DOES IT WORK ⚙️

- 🧬 It's just Python code (with help from AI ;p ) that just chills on your screen reminding you to actually get stuff done!  
- 🐍 Make sure your Windows has **PYTHON INSTALLED**.

## 4. HOW TO USE IT 🖱

-  Triple right click on the text and drag it around.  
-  Change the text or colors.  
-  Right-click on it and you'll see the options.  
-  Either close the command prompt or right-click and select **"Force Stop"**.
