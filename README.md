# Reminder-Tool
Ever got super distracted scrolling through random stuff online when you should be doing homework or something important? Yeah, me too. So I made this thing to fix that lol.



WHAT IS IT:


-So basically I made this Python program that puts a reminder text anywhere on your screen. 

-It's pretty cool because it stays on top of everything else so you can't just ignore it when your procrastinating.

-currently it's made for windows.



WHAT CAN IT DO:


Stays on top Like fr, it won't disappear behind other windows.
You can customize everything - Change the text, make it whatever color you want, resize it, etc :)

HOW DOES IT WORK:


It's just Python code (with help from AI ;p ) that just chills on your screen reminding you to actually get stuff done! Make sure your windows has PYTHON INSTALLED.



HOW TO USE IT:


-Triple click on the text and drag it around.

-Change the text or colors

-Right-click on it and you'll see the options.

-Either close the command prompt or right-click and select "Force Stop".

BHOW TO RUN IT:


1. Download the "reminder.zip" from this repository.
2. Unzip the file
3. Run the Python file.
4. And that's all!


PS I'm still working to make this better by releasing bug fixes and additional features!
